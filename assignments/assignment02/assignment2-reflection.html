          Creating the well organized webpage layout is challenging to me. One
          of the most important thing to consider while creating the folders is
          to name the files and folders correctly. It is also necessary to use
          the tags, syntaxes and properties. There are many of facts learnt
          during the first half of semester, and it is not easy to remember all
          and be able to use properly. Moreover, there will be some errors while
          mentioning the type of html tags, id, and classes while designing the
          webpage.

          When I found out the tags, syntaxes and properties I used were not
          working, I rechecked the typos, reviewed the record of lectures and
          searched on recommended learning websites. Then I fixed some mistakes
          those would lead to errors once I found out. In order to solve the
          problems, I tried to understand them first. When I got confused with
          solving some errors, I had to review lectures pdf. Besides, I could
          check every step of assignment project by using the validator link
          provided by the teachers. Since the validator link normally highlights
          the errors and sometimes it directly indicates the ways to solve. So
          that I can understand the reasons why the codes I have written do not
          work properly on the webpage.

          In creating a webpage layout, HTML and CSS are closely interconnected
          to each other. HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is basically used for
          structuring the contents of webpages while CSS style sheet controls to
          the design and properties of the whole page on a server or local
          computer.

          The most challenging things about assignment are adding values of the
          box models while decorating the webpage. We need to calculate properly
          the every side of paddings, borders, and margins by considering the
          size of contents. Because of using numerous CSS properties on my own
          for the first time, I encountered many of usage errors while I was
          working on assignment. I had to check the structuring orders of HTML
          tags several times.
