          Creating the well organized and clear folder structure is challenging
          to me.One of the most important thing to consider while creating the
          folders is to name the files and folders correctly. It is also
          necessary to ensure the orders of parents and child folders to run on
          server flawlessly without encountering problems. Moreover, there will
          be some errors while linking the files and references unless I follow
          the instruction precisely.

          When I found out the links I clicked were not working, I rechecked the
          HTML tags, typos and the references of the files. Then I fixed some
          mistakes those would lead to errors once I found out. In order to
          solve the problems, I tried to understand them first. When I got
          confused with solving some errors, I had to review lectures pdf.
          Besides, I could check every step of assignment project by using the
          validator link provided by the teachers. Since the validator link
          normally highlights the errors and sometimes it directly indicates the
          ways to solve. So that I can understand the reasons why the codes I
          have written do not work properly on the webpage.

          In web development projects, HTML and the file structure are closely
          interconnected to each other.HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is
          basically used for structuring the contents of webpages while file
          structure refers to store and organize the files and folders on a
          server or local computer.

          The most challenging things about assignment are linking the
          references and the fixing the errors when the links we connected are
          not working. As I'd mentioned above, I used validator and reviewed
          lectures notes and pdf to figure them out.
